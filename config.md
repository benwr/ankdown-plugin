# Ankdown Configuration

The only configuration option is `Markdown Deck Library Path`, which describes
the location of a directory containing your flashcard decks. This path is
relative to your home directory, and defaults to `Flashcard Decks` See the core
documentation to understand how to organize your decks so that ankdown can read
them. This plugin will not modify your filesystem (outside of the ordinary plugin
files in the Anki plugin directory), including to create your deck library.
